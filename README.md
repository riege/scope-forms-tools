Scope Forms Tools
=================

This repository contains tools that are used to develop forms.

Normally, these tools aren't used directly. Instead, the [forms repository](https://bitbucket.riege.de/projects/SCOPE/repos/forms/browse) contains scripts to bootstrap and invoke the software contained in this repository.

This repo is open-source under the [Universal Permissive License](https://opensource.org/licenses/UPL). This allows anonymous cloning, which simplifies the setup for forms developers.

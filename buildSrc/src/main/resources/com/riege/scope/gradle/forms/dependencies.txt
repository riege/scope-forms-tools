###
### Insert manual dependencies here
###
### Syntax is FileA -> FileB, meaning that FileA depends on FileB,
### so changes to FileB also change the results of using FileA
###
### Dependencies are resolved transitively, e.g.
### if A depends on B, and we manually insert B -> C,
### then changes to C will cause A to be rebuild as well.
###
### Paths are relative to src/forms.
### Use '/' as path separator
### Lines starting with # are ignored.
### Empty lines are ignored
### Preceeding and trailing whitespace is ignored.
